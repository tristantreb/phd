    "3. Produce a visualisation of the output of the model which shows all time point at once e.g. have time on the x-axis and some display of the uncertain distributions of the latent variables on the y axis. Could be sideways bar charts or box plots or whatever looks best.\n",
    "4. Then we need to make a longitudinal model which has all data points at once for an individual. The simplest way to do this is to separate out the lung damage and airway blockage variables (as we always intended) and have **one** lung damage variable shared across all time points. This represents the assumption that lung damage is constant at this time scale. Then have separate blockage variables for each time point. Try to get this model running if you can + update your visualisation to include the extra lung damage latent variable."
